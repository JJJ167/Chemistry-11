      <h2>üìè Why and How do we Measure?</h2>
      <p>Measurements are crucial for accuracy and precision in reactions. Without accurate measurements, it's hard to get reliable results or repeat an experiment.</p>
      <p>For example, if you were to bake a cake, and you didn't measure the ingredients correctly, the cake may not rise, taste right, have the correct texture, or even bake properly! In chemistry, it's the same idea, accurate measurements are important to ensure that reactions happen correctly.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="physical properties">
      <h2>üå°Ô∏è Identifying Physical Properties/Changes of Substances</h2>
      <p>Physical properties of substances can be identified by observing characteristics like colour, shape, size, texture, boiling or melting points.</p>
      <p>Physical change occurs when a substance changes form, but it still stays the same substance.</p>
      <p>For example, when ice melts into water, it changes from a solid to a liquid, but it's still H‚ÇÇO</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Nomenclature">
      <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
      <p>Nomenclature is the naming of chemical compounds by following specific rules.</p>
      <p>The rules differ depending on the type of compound.</p>
      <p class="left">Example:
        <br>
        <b><u>Ionic Compounds</u></b> (metal + non-metal)
        <br> <b>NaCl</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Name:</b> Sodium chloride</li>
          <li>Sodium is a metal (cation), and chloride is the non-metal (anion).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For ionic compounds, the metal is written first.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="moles">
      <h2>üî¨ What is a Mole?</h2>
      <p>The mole is a way to count atoms and molecules ‚Äî just like a dozen means 12, a mole means 6.02x10<sup>23</sup> particles! It's a huge number, that is why we use moles to count and measure very small particles in a more manageable way.</p>
      <p>For example, one mole of water contains 6.02x10<sup>23</sup> water molecules. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="chemical reactions">
      <h2>üí•Chemical Reactions</h2>
      <p>Chemical reactions can cause temperature change, colour change, the formation of new substances, etc.</p>
      <p>Chemical equations and word equations are symbols or words used to represent a chemical reaction. </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p><b>Chemical Equation:</b> 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O </p>
      <p><b>Word Equation:</b> Hydrogen + Oxygen &rarr; Water</p>
      <p>Both these equations tell us the same thing, hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="stoichiometry">
      <h2>üßÆStoichiometry</h2>
      <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation that helps us find the amount of reactant needed and the amount of product produced in a chemical reaction. </p>
      <p>For example, to make a s'more, you would need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 graham crackers</li>
        <li>1 piece of chocolate</li>
        <li>1 marshmallow</li>
        <p>If you were to make 7 s'mores, you would need 14 graham crackers, 7 marshmallows, and 7 pieces of chocolate.</p>
    </ul>

    <section id="solutions">
      <h2>üß™Solutions</h2>
      <p>Solutions are homogeneous mixtures</p>
      <P>This unit is about solubility (how well substances dissolve to form solutions) and how to find their concentration.</P>
